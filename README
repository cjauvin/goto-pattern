;; The primary goal of this extension was to allow a very simple and
;; easy navigation system for the function/class definitions of
;; different types of source file (matched with regexps that can vary
;; depending of your style). Of course it can be used with other types
;; of pattern as well. A given pattern must be mapped to a file
;; extension, and it's a one-to-one relationship: to one type of file
;; can only be associated one pattern (the trick is of course to use
;; regexp alternation if you have a need for it).
;;
;; By default, goto-pattern knows about a couple of "source file
;; extension -> function/class definition pattern" mappings (for
;; Python, PHP, JS, *Lisp and SQL). You can add a new one easily by
;; using the interactive function:
;;
;;   M-x g2p-add-pattern
;;
;; If a pattern for the file extension you specified already exists,
;; it will get replaced.
;;
;; This extension can be installed by adding it first to your
;; load-path (in your .emacs):
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/")
;;
;; then requiring it:
;;
;;   (require 'goto-pattern)
;;
;; and finally maybe mapping its entry point function to a handy
;; keyboard shortcut, for instance:
;;
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cgp" 'goto-pattern) ; CTRL-c, + g + p
